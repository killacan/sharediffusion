Welcome to Sharediffusion, an open-source and free platform for sharing and hosting machine learning models. In response to recent developments with CivitAI and their monetization plans, Sharediffusion aims to provide an alternative option that prioritizes openness, freedom, and low cost.

## The Vision

The core idea behind Sharediffusion is to create a community focused platform where users can self-host their own machine learning models. The distribution of models will be facilitated through torrents, ensuring a peer-to-peer sharing mechanism. While future plans may include hosting models centrally, the primary focus currently is on empowering users to manage their own instances.

## Tech Stack

Here's the tech stack chosen for building Sharediffusion:

- **TailwindCSS:** A utility-first CSS framework for efficient styling.
- **Typescript:** Enhancing code quality and maintainability with strong typing.
- **NextJS:** A React framework for building server-rendered applications.
- **Supabase:** An open-source alternative to Firebase, providing a scalable backend.

The choice of image hosting service is still under consideration, and decisions will be made based on practical considerations during the development process.

As the project is in the early planning stages, many details are subject to change as it progresses toward a production version.

## The Promise

We make a commitment to transparency and user-centric principles:

- **No Paywall:** Sharediffusion pledges not to restrict access to models or content behind a paywall.
- **Sustainability:** While seeking donations/funding to sustain the project, it will not interfere with user access to content.

If at any point these promises are compromised, the source code will remain open. Feel free to fork it and take matters into your own hands! Your contributions and involvement in this open-source endeavor are highly valued.
