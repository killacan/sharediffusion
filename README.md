# sharediffusion

Hello and welcome to the project! This is my first attempt at really making something open source and free. Considering recent developments with CivitAI and how they plan on monetizing their platform I decided that there has to be another way. Thus here we are.

### The Plan

The plan here is to create a platform that is open source, free to use, and low cost. How this will be accomplished is by having people self host their own models, and use torrents to share the models.

In the future I might be able to host models as well, but for now I don't have the resources to do so.

### The Tech

I am going to be using the T3 stack (https://create.t3.gg/) for this project.

- TailwindCSS
- Typescript
- tRPC
- NextJS
- Prisma
- NextAuth.js

Still undecided on what database to use, and who to host images with.

This project is still in the early planning stages, so many details might change once things get to an actual production version.

### My Promise

I promise to not keep any models / content behind a paywall. I am going to figure out a way to get donations/funding to keep this project going, but it will not get in the way of the content.

If I break this promise, the source code is here, and you can fork it and do whatever you want with it, so long as it complies with the license.
